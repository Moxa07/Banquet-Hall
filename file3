WHEN DO HIPPOS PLAY?
 

By the African river, know as the Nile,

The sun fell away and it rested a while.

 

The rhinos had braved all the smoldering heat.

They lay down to sleep as they wiped off their feet.

 

 

The elephants marched to their elephant beds,

And gently they rested their elephant heads.

 

The hippos went bathing in cool, shallow pools,

Thinking the rhinos and elephants fools.
